# What Is MVC

**MVC a design pattern commonly used in web development, including PHP applications. It is a way to organize the code and separate concerns in a web application to make it more maintainable and scalable.**

**Model:** The Model represents the data and the business logic of your application. It is responsible for interacting with the database, processing data, and enforcing the rules of the application. In PHP, models are often classes that interact with a database or other data sources.

**View:** The View represents the user interface and the presentation of data to the user. It is responsible for rendering the data obtained from the Model. In PHP, views are often templates that contain HTML and placeholders for dynamic data.

**Controller:** The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives requests from the user, processes them, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and then passes that data to the View for rendering. In PHP, controllers are typically PHP scripts that handle incoming requests and control the flow of the application.
